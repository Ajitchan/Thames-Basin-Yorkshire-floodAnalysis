# Thames-Basin-floodAnalysis

This repository contains tools and resources for analyzing Sentinel 2 satellite imagery of the Thames Basin, a large region in the southeast of England that is prone to flooding. The satellite imagery is provided by the European Space Agency's Sentinel 2 mission and is freely available to download through the Copernicus Open Access Hub.

The tools and resources in this repository are designed to help users process and analyze Sentinel 2 satellite imagery of the Thames Basin in order to identify areas at risk of flooding, map land cover and vegetation, and monitor changes in the region over time.

The repository includes Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step instructions for downloading and processing Sentinel 2 satellite imagery, as well as Python scripts for performing various image analysis tasks, such as calculating NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index) and extracting features such as rivers and roads.
